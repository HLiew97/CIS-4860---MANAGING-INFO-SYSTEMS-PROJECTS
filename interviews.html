          <div><strong>Selection Rationale</strong></div>
          <div>
            My mother’s boss. Mr. Omran is in a field that isn’t directly IT related, but he is a technologically involved
            person, often handling IT-related tasks for his work.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Conversation Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin-top:6px;">
          The conversation began with me explaining the focus of my semester project. I described how I trained the system using
          labeled 48×48 static facial images and tested its accuracy, noting that the project was both challenging and rewarding
          because it was my first real experience with machine learning. Much of the course involved project-management phases
          such as planning, execution, and closing, which shaped how I approached the technical work.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          I then asked Mr. Omran about how project management functions in his work. He explained that every travel group he
          organizes is treated as a project due to constant market changes and unpredictable demand. He described how he analyzes
          past behavior, manages risk, negotiates with airlines and hotels, and adapts to dynamic conditions such as customer
          habits, occupancy needs, and non-refundable inventory. The business, which operates in both B2B and B2C markets,
          requires continual market research, cost control, and strong supplier relationships.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          I asked about qualities he looks for when hiring, and he talked about business changes after COVID-19. He explained how
          the pandemic reshaped staffing strategies, pushing the company to reduce costs, outsource work, rely on commission-based
          roles, and maintain only essential internal staff. He emphasized that different industries require different
          project-management approaches, and he encouraged students to learn from various business models. He also discussed how
          AI is becoming increasingly integrated into their work—for example, through chatbots, automated customer service, and
          improved booking systems.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          Toward the end, the discussion returned to AI. Mr. Omran asked questions about the project model, such as how facial
          expressions are analyzed, how training data works, and whether real-time video recognition is possible. I explained the
          limitations of my semester project, the need for large datasets, and how tools like Google Colab helped me develop and
          train the model. The conversation concluded with reflections on how similar AI tools might be used in the travel industry
          for tasks such as assessing customer satisfaction through video chats or improving security processes.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Project management applies across very different fields. My work in AI and Mr. Omran’s work in travel both rely on
            similar phases, showing that structured project management is universally valuable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understanding customer differences is crucial for AI design. His business highlighted how responses vary by region,
            culture, or religious school of thought, showing why AI systems need context-aware logic and careful training.

          <div><strong>Selection Rationale</strong></div>
          <div>
            Business owner of a partner business for my dad’s company. His company is a card shop that sells trading cards and
            trading card paraphernalia. Not related to IT but it’s related to my current field of work.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Conversation Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin-top:6px;">
          I started by explaining my semester project, training an AI model to recognize human emotions in images. I described using
          a pre-trained face-detection model and then teaching it to classify expressions such as happiness or sadness. This led to
          a broader discussion about learning AI fundamentals, prompting, and how the class encouraged hands-on experimentation
          with AI tools, websites, and models.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          Mr. Shaw responded by sharing personal background as an entrepreneur, recounting how their early business involved creating
          photoshopped memorial montages for funeral homes and how that would have been much faster with modern AI tools. He then
          described his current industry, where product availability and distributor unpredictability make structured planning
          difficult. Most of their project management relies on Google Docs, constant communication, and flexibility because
          allocations, release dates, and supply consistency frequently change.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          When asked about project-management advice, Mr. Shaw emphasized triage and prioritization. He explained that writing
          everything down and ranking tasks with simple systems like 1-2-3 levels of urgency helps prevent overwhelm and ensures
          important tasks are completed first. In his business, this means prioritizing product releases, managing pre-orders
          responsibly, and avoiding overselling to maintain customer trust. He described how chaotic the industry can be and argued
          that adaptability is as important as planning.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          Finally, Mr. Shaw discussed qualities he is looking for when hiring. He said he values “nerdism,” which he explained as
          passion for the industry, strong customer service, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt. While many of their
          employees hold degrees, formal education is less important to him than genuine interest and reliability. He highlighted
          strong team retention, his commitment to supporting employees, and the challenges and importance of delegation.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flexibility is essential in unpredictable industries. Because product allocations, release dates, and supply availability
            constantly change, strict long-term planning doesn’t always work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prioritization is a critical project-management skill. It is important to ensure the most impactful work gets done and to
            prevent lower-priority tasks from derailing progress.

          <div>
            My father, who has run his own business for over a decade.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Conversation Summary</h3>
        <p style="margin-top:6px;">
          My father gave advice on learning project management, emphasizing the importance of setting clear objectives, defining
          timelines, and assigning tasks based on team members’ strengths. He talked about maintaining a checklist of
          responsibilities, meeting regularly to review progress, and adjusting as needed. I told him about how the class followed
          a similar structured process. We talked about how aligning tasks with individual strengths leads to better project
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          We then talked about different communication styles in a team and managing conflicts because of another group project that
          I am doing. He talked about how to give constructive feedback and maintain transparency with other members. He said
          sometimes managing and planning with other people needs a lot of discussion early. If all else fails, developing backup
          plans and adapting to unexpected situations is the only thing you can do.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          Lastly, we talked about his business and how he manages it with project management. Since his company is small, there’s no
          real need for him to do formal project-management paperwork. However, like he said before, the process of planning
          everything, then executing, and then reviewing, is something that he does all the time. So, in that way, he always
          practices project management, even without full documentation or planning tools.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Effective project management relies more on clear communication and strategic task-assignment than on formal tools. Even
            if you don’t take time to write down all the parts of project management you do, in practice it is still a valuable process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adaptability and early discussion are essential for navigating teamwork challenges. People can’t read each other’s minds,
            so if there are conflicting opinions or ideas, the only way to settle it is to discuss.
