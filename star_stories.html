          <h3>11. Embrace adaptability and resiliency — Pivot Under Pressure</h3>
          <p>For a project I was doing where I was developing an AI model for emotion recognition, I had to install the framework into my local computer and run training using my own hardware. Unfortunately, there was an error with the installation due to outdated software incompatibility. To accomplish the project, I needed to find a way to train the model. To work around this issue, I transferred the project to a cloud platform, Google Colab. Using Google’s computational power, I was able to run the project without having to use my local machine. As a result, my project was able to be completed with no further technical complications. I learned how to quickly respond to sudden challenges to my plans.</p>

          <h3>11. Embrace adaptability and resiliency — Recovery from Failure</h3>
          <p>I had a team presentation for a class where the work distribution had everyone construct the content of the presentation and we would have one person do the presentation itself. The week before presentation, our presenter got very sick and would be unable to present. We had to adapt to this, so we coordinated to each take a section of the presentation and would cover the work. I wrote some notecards for my section and the day of the presentation I was prepared to speak in the place of our presenter. Ultimately this was not necessary, as the presentation was pushed to another date, but I learned how to quickly reorganize project plans and maintain readiness under unexpected disruptions.</p>

          <p>Around the start of COVID, I had a job in the restaurant business. Because people could no longer go out, we could not continue normal business operations. To adjust to COVID, we switched to a take-out centric business model, and most of my work became handling to-go orders. I learned how to handle a mixture of phone/online orders, food packaging, and customer service during social distancing. I learned how to adapt to system-level changes by adapting to external factors and stayed productive and flexible.</p>

          <h3>6. Demonstrate leadership behaviors — Adaptive Leadership Style</h3>
          <p>I had a group project for a class that required collaborative work throughout the semester. Normally for group projects I like to complete the work as early as possible to allow for revisions or sudden issues. For this one project, I was the team lead and found that one of my teammates had trouble following that workflow, preferring to complete all the work very close to the deadline. I had to adapt my leadership style to account for this without sacrificing the revision phase. Rather than enforce my work style on him, I would complete my work and review his portion as he would work on it. This maintained quality while allowing for his work style. As a result, we were able to complete the project with less friction between members. This event taught me effective leadership requires flexibility in managing diverse work styles.</p>

          <h3>9. Navigate complexity — Simplifying Complexity</h3>
          <p>I had a project that involved teaching multiple people a complex game system that I was not comfortably familiar with. To break this problem into manageable pieces, I isolated aspects of the project and organized them into an order that I felt would allow me to efficiently complete the project. First, I studied the system and learned about the nuances that might confuse people. I then practiced how I would convey this information to others and anticipated questions they had. I then taught them the system in small groups to better respond to individual confusions. Afterwards, the people I taught complimented me on how knowledgeable I was in the system and felt confident in their own understanding of the system. In this way, I learned how to break down a compound issue and became better at navigating complexity.</p>
